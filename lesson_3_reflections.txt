1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git directory is created, with no commits in it. Git saves metadata here.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It sits between the working directory and the repository. It allows us to make one commit per logical change.
